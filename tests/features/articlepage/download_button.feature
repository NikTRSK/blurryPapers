  Scenario: Check for Download text button
    Given I am on the homepage "http://localhost:3000"
    When I enter "Smith" in the "#search-input-box"
    When The "#search-button" is clicked
    When I select a "Present" from the "#word-cloud"
    Then I expect to see a "#articles-dl-txt-button" download button with the text "Download List as TXT"
