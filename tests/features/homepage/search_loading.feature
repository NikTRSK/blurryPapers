Feature: Search Loading
  I should be able to go to see the progress of the search page loading

  Scenario: When I search for something, it should show me a progress bar
    Given I am on the homepage "http://localhost:3000/"
    And The search bar is empty
    And I enter "Smith"
    And I click the "#search-button"
    Then I expect a "#status-bar" to show me the progress
