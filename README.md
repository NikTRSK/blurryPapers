# 310-Project2
Super awesome app for project 2 (Working title)

##Commit rules
1. ***Do not*** commit directly to the master branch.
2. Have a branch for every feature we implement. Potentially branch out for every task.
3. Once you feel confident with the feature merge it with the master branch (we’ll go over this for anyone not familiar with it)

###Commiting and Commit Messages
1. Commit often since they will be looking at pacing.
2. As mentioned above never commit to master
3. Format of the commit messages should be as follows:
	`<commit type>: <message>; <partner1>, <partner2>`

#####commit type:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T - Test
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F - Feature/Function/Functionality
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B - Bugfix of existing code
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M - Merge request into branch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D - (no, no it’s not the D) Any sort of documentation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C - Cleanup. Anything that doesn’t change functionality (removing commented out code, adding comments, etc)
message: description of what you have done
partner1, partner2: optional. If you pair programming

Ex commit message:
	T: implemented tests for xyz; Jean, Jin
