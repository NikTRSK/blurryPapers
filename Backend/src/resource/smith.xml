    <![CDATA[We explore a novel online packet scheduling model related to energy-efficiency in mobile data transport. This model incorporates multiple networks with non-persistent connectivities where we only know which networks are available in the current timestep. When a packet arrives, it specifies a deadline and, for each network, a value it is worth if sent over that network. Our goal is to maximize the total value of packets we send by their deadlines. To encourage energy-efficiency, our model requires that packets have larger values for more energy-efficient networks. We demonstrate low-constant-competitive algorithms for this problem and several restrictions. We also provide lower bounds which closely match our competitive ratios and, under some restrictions, are tight.]]>
