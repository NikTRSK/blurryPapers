(c) Single-device charger with the device under test. Ferrite is not shown to illustrate the coils.Finally, we extended our origin al concept design described above and applied it to a commercially released phone: the LG G4. RCE is compared for two different congurations to establish relative performance: the rst one is a conventional receiving coil, designed to comply with AFA requirements (wire diameter = 0.5 mm, turns = 4, and area = 2795 mm2 ) , placed inside the original plastic back cover; the second one is a newly designed receiver coil on a metal back cover (wire diameter = 0.5 mm, turns = 5, and area = 1210 mm2 ) . Fig. 16(a) and (b) depicts the photographs of these two implementations. We tested these two congurations on an AFA-compliant PTU (WPR3501C) shown in Fig. 16(c). The results areTA B L E V COMPARISONBETWEENPLASTIC ANDMETALCOV E R Sreported in Table V, which shows how the two implementations result in an RCE very similar to each other, notwithstanding the signicantly smaller receiver coil used for the metal body implementation, which may prove to be an additional advantage in space-constraine d applications. This conrms the viability and good perfo rmance of wireless power transfer through a metal body for a loosely coupled magnetic resonant charging technology. VI. CONCLUSIONWe demonstrate that magnetic resonance technology is suit- able to deliver an appropriate power to a smartphone equipped with a metal body. Multiple metal-body phones can also be charged on a standard AFA-comp atible charger, showing no negative system impact due to the presence of such large amount of metal on the platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst study aimed at practically demonstrating the feasibility of wireless charging of a device enclosed by a metal body.

Measurement setup.other congurations. In this case, L increases more than in case (d) because ferrite connes magnetic eld and results in higher L . Maximum and minimum M also increase at the cost of increased R owing to loss in the ferrite material. This also indicates that the primary path of mutual coupling is not directly from magnetic eld through the opening but from the induced eddy currents. Next, we examine the effect of the side coils. As previously mentioned in Section II, four combinations of coil windingsare examined. Table IV shows maximum and minimum M for each combination and compares them to M of the center coil only. When side coils are added and connected to the center coil in series, M becomes signicantly higher than that of the center coil. Among the four windings cases, the highest M is found when both the left and right coils are wound counterclockwise. Maximum and minimum M are 336 and 242 nH, respectively, which is 61% and 75% higher compared to that of the center coil only. This corresponds well with simulation results that were described in Section II. Now, we set up equipment to measure rectied voltage, current, and delivered power. The details of the setup are shown in Fig. 13. First, the driving current from a power amplier in the PTU is measured through a current probe andFig. 14. Maximum and minimum power locations. The small black circle indicates the home button in the phone.Fig. 15. Simultaneous wireless char ging of three metal encased phones on an AFA-compatible transmitter.continuously monitored throughout the entire measurement. This allows a designer to conrm the status of the current from the PTU. Second, the electronic load resistance is varied to measure the delivered power. Third, rectied voltage and current at the load are measured. The debug board is used to keep monitoring the PTU and PRU‚Äôs operating conditions. This includes measuring the initial transmitting current from the power amplier, PTU impedance shift, PRU rectied voltage, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) connection status, and so on. Fig. 14 shows maximum and minimum power to the elec- tronic load as well as their respective location of the PRU on the transmitter. The power is obtained by multiplying the voltage and current from measurements. The maximum power for this design is measured to be 8.2 W at the maximum M position and minimum power is observed to be 6.8 W at the minimum coupling location. Furthermore, temperature on the metal back cover is tested with a number of temperature sensors. We measured 44 ¬∞C at the hottest spot in a steady state condition after one hour of continuous operation at maximum power, which is compatible with mobile devices‚Äô requirements. In addition, we tested and conrmed that multiple metal backed phones can be charged on the same PTU, thus ensuring compatibility with A4WP/AFA system specications. As shown in Fig. 15, three metal back cover phones are successfully charged on a sta ndard AFA-compatible PTU. This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Fabricated metal body including ferrite and circuit board.the metal body and aligns to the phone battery charging contacts. The complete fabricated metal body assembly is showninFig.12. V. MEASUREMENTPrior to measuring overall system performance, we rst characterize the center and side coils. The center coil is examined with ve different design congurations. Table III shows a brief description and photographs of each conguration of the center coil and metal plate. L , R , and M are measured with a network analyzer (Agilent N5230). Case (a) shows when a 5-turn center coil itself is tested, L and R are measured to be 964 nH and 0.5 at 6.78 MHz. The maximum M location is found at the center of a n AFA-compliant transmitter (WPR 3502) and minimum M location is at the edge of the transmitter. Maximum and minimum M is121and42nH, respectively. In case (b), a full copper metal sheet is placed under the coil. L drops to 301 nH which is 31.2% lower than the original L . Simultaneously, R increases by 43% to 0.7 and maximum M expectedly drops to 2 nH. In case (c), an opening representing a camera lens hole is introduced to the area of the inner portion of the coil, as illustrated in its top and bottom views. L increases by 42 nH from the case with the full metal sheet. However, M is still very low because the loop around the hole is short-circuited. Hence, we create a vertical slot starting from the camera hole to the end of the metal sheet, as shown in case (d). Remarkably, L returns to a higher value of 803 nH, while maintaining R at the same level of 0.7 . Maximum and minimum M are measured to be 220 and 139 nH, which are 82% and 230% increase from coil only case, respectively. This substantial improvement is predicted from the simulation where the eddy current driven by a transmitter is coupled to the receiver coil. The maximum M position appears when the opening and coil are aligned with maximum magnetic eld distribution of the transmitter. Last, in case (e) a 0.3-mm-thick ferrite is placed over the opening, slot and coil, as shown in the top view. The bottom area is left without ferrite so that the transmitting magnetic eld can emanate to the entire metal plate in the same way as for the This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

(b ) Actual implementation.its mechanical robustness is also suitable for handheld devices. The completely machined metal body is shown in Fig. 9(c). One of the critical features is to design and implement electrical contacts to each coil as well as to a circuit card assembly (CCA) board. In our design, there are four contacts; two from the center coil to the two side coils, and the other two from the side coil to the CCA. For the two contacts between the center coil wire and the side metal frame coils, we use low-loss silver epoxy glue, because these electrical contacts may signicantly affect total resistance of the coil at the operating frequency of 6.78 MHz. The mechanical model and actual implementation are shown in Fig. 10. A part of the side coil is used as the surface area for glue, which is 2 √ó 3mm2. It takes approximately six hours to completely cure the silver epoxy. In general, if the surface area for glue gets bigger, the resistance decreases and mechanical robustness is enhanced. For the other two contacts, between the side coils and CCA, we observed that the thickness of the ending portionof the side coil is much thinner than those for the previous contacts. The available area was only 1 √ó 1mm2,whichis ve times smaller. To overcome this issue, we printed a 3-D supporting structure made of plastic and mounted a pogo pin, as shown in Fig. 11(a). This way, we are able to make reliable and low-loss contact from the CCA to the side wall. The implementation is illustrated in Fig. 11(b). Ferrite is also an important component in designing a coil and in integrating it with other metallic objects in a device.There are two major roles of ferrite in this design. The rst is that ferrite magnetically shields the coils from nearby metallic objects, which include battery, shielding cans, PCB, camera, and exible PCB inside the phone. The second is that ferrite increases self-inductance of the coil and in turn enhances mutual inductance between the transmitter and receiver. In our design, 0.2-mm-thick FJ7 ferrite from TDK is attached to the center and side coils, as shown in Figs. 10‚Äì12. The permeability and magnetic loss tangent are 170 and 0.02, respectively. Now, a CCA is attached to measure rectied voltage and power. This CCA includes impedance matching network, rectier, EMI lter, dc‚Äìdc converter, debug connectors, and shielding can. The coil is connected to the ac contact points on the CCA as an input from the coil. The dc output after rectication is connected to the exible PCB that runs along This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Transmission coefcient between three coils with port impedance of 50 . Port 1 is dened at the transmitter, while port 2 is dened at the receiving coil.Then, the current of each coil is found by multiplying the inverse of the impedance matrix on both sides [ I ]=[ Z ]≈ 1 [ V ] . (3) The input impedance seen by the transmitter is then expressed as Z IN = V 1 I 1 . (4) Using these equations, analytical calculation is conducted with a mathematical analysis software. In simulating and measuring S-parameters, 50- port impedances are used for simplicity. Fig. 8 illustrates transmission coefcients in this system. The simulation results match fairly well with the measurements. S 21is observed to be as low as ≈ 25 dB, while S 23is relatively higher at ≈ 16 dB. S 13is simulated at ≈ 7 dB. Interestingly, S 23does not show resonant characteristics because the metal back cover and receiver coil are tightly coupled to each other. When two resonators are coupled together, the reected impedance is inverted [21]‚Äì[23]. In our design with three coils, one can expect a double impedance inversion. However, because of tight coupling in S 23, the input impedance is inverted only once, which allows us to continue to design the transmitter as a current source. In commercial implementations, a designer may want to customize their circuitry for a PTU and PRU including power amplier, electromagnetic interference (EMI) lter, rectier, and dc‚Äìdc converter. Because of this reason, system overall efciency may vary based on their application-specic implementation. Thus, in this paper, we focus on calculating resonator coupling efciency (RCE) which is circuit-independent. First, we dene input and output ports, as the AFA species a two-port system: the input port is dened at the transmitter coil and the output port at the receiver coil. Two-port S-parameters are extracted from HFSS simula tion and then converted to theTA B L E I I RCEcorresponding Z -parameters. The impedances seen at the input and output ports can be expressed as [24] Z IN = Z 11 ≈ Z 12 Z 21 Z 22 + ZL (5) Z OUT = Z 22 ≈ Z 12 Z 21 Z 11 + ZS (6) where ZL and ZS are load and source port impedances, respec- tively. Then, conjugate matching is calculated for maximum transfer efciency as Z IN = Z S (7) Z OUT = Z L (8) where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. By solving (7) and (8) for ZL and ZS , the optimal load and source impedances are found. Then, substituting these optimal port imp edances back into the Z -parameters and converting them to its corresponding S-parameters, perfectly matched S-parameter s are computed. Finally, RCE is computed using | S 21 | 2. Table II shows 83% RCE when input and output ports are perfectly matched in the calculation described above. Efciency results measured on a commercial platform will be shown later in the measurement section. IV. FABRICATIONTo implement the aforementione d wireless charging struc- ture, the metal body is manufactured with a sophisticated multistage process. Below are three steps to complete the metal body. Step 1) Machine an aluminum block. Step 2) Fill cavities with plastic via silicone mold. Step 3) Remove aluminum supporters via post machining. Fig. 9 shows the fabricated metal bodies before and after plastic molding. In Fig. 9(a), a lump of aluminum is machined to make a bucket-shape of the metal body and is milled out to create wireless charging coils on the side walls and communication antennas on the top and bottom metal walls. During this machining and m illing process, the metal body is sectored into ve individual segments; back, top, bottom, right, and left. These individual elements are held by supporting structures, as shown in Fig. 9(a). Next, the machined part is molded with silicone plastic which eventually holds the entire metal structure, as illustrated in Fig. 9(b). Note that the supporting ridges are molded together and a master part is separately made to better create the silicone mold. Finally, in Step 3, the unnecessary plastic and supporting ridges are milled out. For the selection of the base metal material, we choose aluminum 6061-T651 because it is widely used in commercial phone products. This almost pure aluminum material has good conductivity as compared to that of copper and This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Also, the vertical component of the magnetic eld is primarily present only at the camera hole and attenuates on the right and left side areas, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Alternatively, when the right coil is wound counterclockwise and the left coil is wound clockwise in Fig. 6(b), the magnetic eld on the right side shows more vertical components than that of the left side. Finally, when both coils are wound counterclockwise in Fig. 6(c), the magnetic eld on both left and right sides is more vertically polarized at each end of the metal cover, and the vertical magnetic component is strong at both right and left areas. Therefore, we demonstrate that winding counterclockwise on both sides would signicantly increase mutual coupling. In Section IV, the measurement results of each corresponding coil conguration conrm the analysis. III. EQUIVALENTCIRCUITFrom the previous observation that the transmitting mag- netic eld induces eddy currents on the metal body which in turn couples to the receiver coil, we consider the proposed coil design as a three-coil system: the rst is the transmitter resonator, the second is the coil formed by the metal body, and the third is the receiver resonator. In this paper, the transmitter coil is a 6-turn spiral with AWG 14 wire (about 1.6 mm in diameter) and its size is 210 √ó 140 mm2(the design parameters can be found in the AFA approved Class 3 PTU resonator QC3502 and are also shown in Fig. 6 of the cited paper [20]). The distance from the transmitter coil to the charging surface is 6 mm: this distance will be used for all simulations and measurements, as it is a fairly typical case for many loosely coupled implementations, which allow the embedding of the transmitter. AFA standards allow for a range of mutual coupling values, which extends the compatibility of the receiver to signicantly larg er distances than the one used, with a small penalty on overall efciency. The volume of the metal body is 136 √ó 70 √ó 8mm3(representative of a typical handset) and its thickness is 1 mm. The size of the receiver coil attached to the metal body is approximately 25 √ó 30 mm2and its wire diameter is 0.25 mm, while the spacing is 0.5 mm,which is created by the insulation coating of the wire. Since the receiver resonator coil needs to maximize the coupling to the eddy currents generated in the metal body, the camera opening dictates the dimension of the coil, which is tightly wound around the periphery of the opening. The size of the wire and spacing of the wires ar e optimized to t the required number of turns to achieve the target mutual coupling (thus satisfying AFA standard requirements) while keeping the turns sufciently separated in order to minimize parasitic coupling and maintain the coil structure on a single layer. Fig. 7 shows the equivalent circuit of this three-coil system. Self-inductance from each coil is L 1, L 2,and L 3, respectively. Ohmic resis- tance, which contributes loss in each coil, is R 1, R 2,and R 3, respectively. C 1and C 3are the capacitors required to tune PTU and PRU to the resonance frequency at 6.78 MHz. M 12is the mutual inductance between PTU and metal back cover. M 23is mutual inductance between metal back cover and PRU.Fig. 7. Equivalent circuit with a metal body between PTU and PRU. TA B L E I SIMULATED L , R ,AND MM 13is mutual inductance between PTU and PRU, and so on. In order to measure L 2,and R 2for the equivalent circuit, we dene a port in the vertical slot of the metal body in HFSS and thus extract the two parameters. Table I shows the simulated values for each component mentioned earlier. The PRU is modeled with a metal body, receiving coil, and a lumped me tal block to represent the PCB, display, and battery. Note that the thickness of the metal body has a minor impact on mutual coupling: by simulation, a change in metal thickness from 0.5 to 1 mm only affects M 13by 3.8%. From a design perspective, a wireless designer can increase mutual inductance by increasing the openings, length of the vertical slot, the number of receiving coil turns, or by decreasing the thickness of the metal body. The relationship between volta ges and currents is described with an impedance matrix in [ V ]=[ Z ][ I ] . (1) In an expanded form V 1 V 2 V 3 = 1 sC 1 + sL 1 + R 1 sM 12 sM 13 sM 12 sL 2 + R 2 sM 23 sM 12 sM 231 sC 3 + sL 3 + R 3 √ó I 1 I 2 I 3 . (2) Since there is a voltage source only in the PTU, V 2and V 3are set to zero. The currents remain as the unknowns in (2).

The entire back cover is used as a wireless charging antenna (left, right , and back plates) and communication antennas (top and bottom plates). (b) Side view of a side coil implemented on the metal back cover. B. Side Coil Design The center coil typically provides sufcient mutual coupling at varying size of the opening. However, our study identies that a side coil can substitute or complement the function of the center coil. More specically, in the case when a center opening does not exist, a side coil can solely provide sufcient mutual coupling. In the case of a very small opening, it can boost the mutual coupling together with the center coil. Fig. 5(a) shows the left and right side coils on a metal back cover. They are rst mach ined, molded with a plastic material, and then connected in series with the center coil. In this paper, 1.5 turns are realized from each side of the metal frame. Spaces are kept as part of the design of the machined trace for volume and power button keys. To mitigate undesired coupling to communication antennas, these side coils are physically isolated from the top and bottom metal plates.Fig. 6.

(c) Right: countercl ockwise and left: counterclockwise. Dashed red line: charging surface.The side view in Fig. 5(b) shows how the side coils are obtained by machining the metal cover itself. One important design consideration is that coil conguration must be designed to align with the transmitter‚Äôs magnetic eld ux direction. There are four possible orientations of windings as follows: 1) clockwise‚Äìclockwise; 2) clockwise‚Äìcounterclockwise; 3) counterclockwise‚Äìclockwise; 4) counterclockwise‚Äìcounterclockwise. To identify the most efcient winding conguration, an electromagnetic simulation is conducted with Ansys HFSS as shown in Fig. 6.

Note that as frequency is lowered, induction heating becomes too extreme to implement a practical charging solution [2]. Despite these difculties, in this paper, we show a technique to enable wireless charging through a metal-body device at 6.78 MHz. A. Center Coil Design To address the problem, we rst simplify a 3-D metal body as a at metal sheet with an existing opening of a camera lens and examine how an induced eddy current ows in the metal. By running electromagnetic simulation with Ansys HFSS, we found that when a transmitter generates vertical magnetic eld, an eddy current is induced on the metal back cover due to Faraday‚Äôs law. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the strength and direction of eddy currents when a camera opening is present. The strongest eddy currents ow along the edge of the metal body and clockwise as shown in Fig. 2(a). Little self-inductance is observed, as the loop around the camera hole of the metal cover is short-circuited. Interestingly, when a vertical slot is introduced from the opening to the edge of the metal sheet, the eddy currents are diverted toward the opening, circulate around the hole, and create relatively signicant selfinductance, as illustrated in Fig . 2(b). Note that the current circulates counterclockwise around the hole as opposed tothe direction in the slot-free case. Taking advantage of this circling eddy current, we place a receiving coil around the camera hole and wind a wire tightly close to the hole in order to maximize mutual coupling between the metal cover and the receiver coil. The receiving coil is also positioned 5 mm away from the communication antenna to minimizeFig. 3. Geometry of center coil. (a) Camera and ash holes with vertical slots.

To further expand the area of eddy current induction, predened opening (i.e., a ash hole) is additionally connected to the camera hole by another vertical slot, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, to achieve mutual coupling, predened features of a metal cover are utilized and the center coil is positioned to maximize coupling to the strongly induced eddy currents around the opening. Within this design framework, the detailed geometry of the center coil is then determined. Since wire diameter directly inuences ohmic resistance of the coil, we chose AWG 30(i.e., 0.25 mm in diameter) for lower loss. The turn spacing contributes parasitic capacitance between each turn and also consequently affects self-resonance frequency of the coil. More importantly, as the spacing affects the amount of coupling to the induced eddy current, the wire is tightly wound and its spacing is 0.5 mm equaling total thickness of two wires‚Äô insulation. This tight winding leads to a simplied manufacturing process because each coil turn is placed side by side and the coil position is situated close to the openings. Next, the number of coil turns is examined to meet a system requirements while being placed on top of the metal sheet. Fig. 4 shows that mutual inductance and ohmic resistance increase as the number of coil turns increases. In other words, a higher mutual inductance can be achieved by sacricing resistive losses, and reducing system efciency. In an AFA system, a PTU has a range of acceptable mutual inductance. The lowest mutual inductance is determined by PRU minimum boot up voltage. The highest mutual inductance is determined by over voltage protection in a PRU. General practice is that a designer can prioritize mutual coupling at the expense of lower efciency which leads to slow charging. The criteria is subject to each designer‚Äôs system requirements.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES 1Wireless Charging of a Metal-Body DeviceNathan Seongheon Jeong, Member, IEEE , and Francesco Carobolante, Member, IEEE Abstract ‚Äî Conventional tightly coupled inductive charging has been popular in the mobile device market for years. However, tightly coupled solutions have been unable to efciently charge a metal encased device due to substantial heat generation. In this paper, we demonstrate that loosely coupled inductive charging technology is a viable solution to charge a metal encased device. Ample power can be delivered through the metal case with negligible case heating. Our prototype is built by machining alump of aluminum which is attached to a commercial smart phone. Resonator coupling efciency is measured to be 90% with a certied AirFuel Alliance transmitter. Measured power to a load is 8.2 W, which is suitable for mobile devices. Index Terms ‚Äî Airfuel alliance (AFA), loosely coupled resonant system, magnetic resonance, metal body wireless charging. I. INTRODUCTION W IRELESSLY charging electronic devices are widely available today but their charging capability has been greatly limited by the inability to charge a metal-body device. In mobile device charging, tightly coupled inductive charging technology has been extensively adopted in recent years [1]‚Äì[7]. Typically, its operating frequency is in the rangeof 100 to 200 kHz, as developed and promoted by the wireless power consortium. Such technology necessitates strong mutual coupling between a power transmitting unit (PTU) and a power receiving unit (PRU) leading to a high coupling coefcient up to 0.9. Because of this stringent re quirement, it further requires a PRU to be precisely aligned with a PTU. Although resonant coupling can be implemented also at these lower frequencies, thus obviating the need for precise alignment, one critical drawback is that a metal body electronic device cannot be charged due to substantial heat generation by induced eddy current [2]. Loosely coupled magnetic resonant charging technology provides signicant advantages relative to tightly coupled inductive charging t echnology [8]‚Äì[13], als o thanks to utilizing a higher frequency. As specied by AirFuel Alliance (AFA), formerly the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP), it operates at 6.78 MHz and leverages resonance to enable coupling coefcients that can be less than 0.1, permitting spatial freedom in any directions or orientations. This feature allows users to freely place their mobile devices within a charging area or volume.

Another advantage of magnetic resonance technology is its ability to charge multiple devices simultaneously with a single transmitter. Low and high power can be concurrently delivered to substantially different devices, from wearables to smartphones and notebooks. Fig. 1 shows an example of a loosely coupled charging system where a PTU denes an available wireless charging volume and a PRU is placed anywhere within the volume. The magnetic linkage is made through a vertically polarized magnetic eld. Since the development of this technology, a major challenge has been to charge a device with a metal body, which is common for many devices in the market, from smartphones to tablets. In 2015 for the rst time, we demonstrated the feasibility of wireless charging a metal encased smartphone at the Mobile World Congress in Spain. The work has been recently published in a short paper [14]. In this paper, we further investigate the design to provide details of theoretical analysis, design guideline, and actual implementation. This paper is organized as follows. Resonator design is explained in Section II. Equivalent circuit and analysis are shown in Section III. Fabrication and measurement are illustrated in Sections IV and V, respectively. II.
